**About the OpenStrata Initiative**

We believe the Microsoft Power Platform ecosystem benefits from a robust Supply Chain of Production-Ready-To-DDCI Power Platform capabilities.

The OpenStrata Initiative is an open-source project with the explicit objective to facilitate a standardized framework for Publishers and Consumers within the Microsoft Power Platform ecosystem to **Distribute**, **Discover**, **Consume**, and **Integrate** (DDCI) production-ready Power Platform 
capabilities.
